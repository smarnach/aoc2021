Advent of Code 2021 solutions
=============================

My goals for this year's Advent of Code:

* Solve as many of the problems as I find time for. It won't be all of them.

* Write idiomatic Rust.

* Don't panic on invalid input (though I won't guard against arithmetic overflows).

* Have fun.
